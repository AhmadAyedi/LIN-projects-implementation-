that is incredible it worked exactly as expected 
now instead of controlling a led we have a more complex requirement 
in fact user will no longer turn on/off led he will control a wiper in vehicle now 
so in the web interface we will have a wiper where the user can choose 
to activate the front or back wiper or both at the same time and each have 
2 speed mode : normal speed and fast speed and each have also number of 
cycles a user can choose from 1 to 5 cycles 

all that will be in a user interface like we did earlier (html css js) 
and we will rebuild our backend as well to communicate with user's events 
and requests and send to mongodb then like usual rasp1 will retrieve 
those request from mongodb and send it via LIN bus (using the library) 
to rasp2 that will trigger it self the front and back wipers according 
to user's requests 

we will not use a real wiper actuator because we don't have the hardware 
so we will use 3 leds on pins (gpio 23 and 24 and 25 ) that will 
act as a front wiper and 3 other leds (gpio 16 and 20 and 21) that will act
 as a back wiper 
we will simulate a wiper(front or back) using 3 LEDs  where the LEDs light 
up one by one from right to left like a wiper swipe, and this repeats
(number of cycles set by the user) at a speed based on the selected level. 
When the speed increases, the delay between lighting each LED decreases,
 making the wiper "move" faster.

let's build a new project named wiper_LIN where we build our front 
and backend and then we name our mongodb database LIN_wiper7 and then we 
do the master(rasp1) and slave(rasp2) codes
